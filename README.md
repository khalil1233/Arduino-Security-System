## First-time setup
When turning on the system for the first time a message will show telling that you
need to enroll a fingerprint, you simply need to put your finger on the sensor and
follow the instructions show on the screen.
After you enroll your first fingerprint you are good to go and the system will start
working as intended to.
## Adding and Removing Fingerprints and Factory Resting

settings menu by clicking and holding the "ok" button for several seconds until the
